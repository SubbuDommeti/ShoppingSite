    I would like to share some small details about the ShoppingSite Web Application.

    This was developed using Laravel php framework. It is in beta version. This is a basic E-commerce web application.<br>
    This has two views based on the type of user who is logged in.
    1. Admin
    2.End User

    The End User can only view the products.
    The Admin User can add products,add categories and add banners as well.
