    Hello Everyone! Greetings of the Day

    I would like to share some small details about the ShoppingSite Web Application.

    This was developed using Laravel php framework. It is in beta version. This is a basic E-commerce web application.<br>
    This has two views based on the type of user who is logged in.
    <ul>
        <li>Admin</li>
        <li>End User</li>    
    </ul>

    The End User can only view the products.
    The Admin User can add new products and categories and banners as well.
