Hello Everyone! Greetings of the Day.

I would like to share some key details about the ShoppingSite Web Application.

Development: The ShoppingSite Web Application was developed using the Laravel PHP framework. It is currently in the beta version, undergoing continuous improvements and enhancements.

E-commerce Functionality: The application serves as a basic e-commerce web platform, providing users with the ability to browse and preview products online.

User Views: The application offers two distinct views based on the type of user logged in:
  End User: The end user view allows customers to browse and view products available on the platform.
  Admin User: The admin user view grants administrators additional privileges, including the ability to add products, manage categories, and create banners for promotional purposes.

Thank you for your attention.
